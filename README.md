# Credit Card Applications Fraud Detection

This project involves the use of a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) for the detection of fraud in credit card applications. SOM is an artificial neural network used for clustering data and visualization. In this project, we use SOM to analyze credit card applications and identify applications that may indicate fraud.

## Getting Started

You can run this project by following these steps:

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/).
2. Download or clone the project files to your computer.
3. Navigate to the project folder and run the following command to install the required dependencies:
4. Run the `main.py` file in the project folder:

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- minisom

## Code Explanations

In this project, we load the data, scale the features, and use SOM to analyze credit card applications. You can utilize the results of SOM to detect applications that may indicate fraud.

The main objective of the project is to enhance the screening of credit card applications and identify cases of fraud more effectively.

By using this project, you can gain a better understanding of credit card applications and perform fraud detection.
